# POV-WebGL-RocketMovement

The assignment was to add new controller to the rocket so it could fly/move around the scene. The controller are forward and backwards. 

***Before starting to describe the steps, I might say that I can LOT of problems with the start-project giving multiple errors which one last one I could understand neither fixed. So, after multiple hours of troubleshoot the code, I decided to use the project which contain the shadow already called (simplegame). In that case, the same add code for the control of the rocket didnt give me the error. Finally, I wne ahead and finish the project.***


These were the steps:
1. Change the .net version to 6.0.4 (installed at my pc).
2. Go to the Controller.razor.cs file and add a new method to keydownEvent for the letter "w" and "s".
3. Stop the movement when keyupEvent.
4. Add the new methods to the controller.razor so it can execute the action
5. Save and build it - if not errors...
6. Run the program
7. Copy the generated localhost and render the rocket
8. Test with keyboard "w" and "s"
9. Then, you finish
